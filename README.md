###Google VR SDK for iOS
--
With the Google VR SDK for iOS, you can develop inexpensive virtual reality (VR) tools and let your users enjoy VR in a simple, fun, and natural way. Developers familiar with OpenGL can quickly start creating VR applications. The SDK simplifies many common VR development tasks, including:

Lens distortion correction.
Spatial audio.
Head tracking.
3D calibration.
Side-by-side rendering.
Stereo geometry configuration.
User input event handling.
We're keeping the hardware and software open to encourage community participation and compatibility with VR content available elsewhere.

To learn more:
